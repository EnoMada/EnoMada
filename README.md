## 🧠 **How I Think as an Analyst**

I approach cybersecurity the same way I used to manage high-pressure retail ops: with clarity, urgency, and attention to what *really matters*. Here’s how I operate in the SOC mindset:

- 🚨 Every alert is a puzzle — I don’t just mute it, I *prove it false or true*  
- 🔁 I prioritize fast dispositioning: reduce noise, surface threats  
- 🔍 I pivot fast — from logs to packets, from endpoints to context  
- 🧩 I write clear, human-readable timelines, not just event IDs  
- 📚 I log everything — not just for the record, but to train my future self  

---

## 📚 **Currently Exploring**

To deepen my capabilities as a SOC Analyst and future Detection Engineer, I'm actively learning:

- 🛠 Writing Sigma rules for alerting patterns I’ve already triaged manually  
- ⚙️ Correlating Wazuh, Zeek, and Suricata data for full traffic visibility  
- 🧠 MITRE ATT&CK mapping + Red Canary tradecraft analysis  
- 🌐 Cloud log analysis and detection strategy (GCP / AWS / Azure)

## 🎯 **Why Hire Me?**

✅ **Real-World Threat Analysis** — Enriched WAF alerts, confirmed valid account compromise, and led full response cycle  
✅ **Precision + Adaptability** — From packet captures to Splunk queries, I adapt quickly and triage with intent  
✅ **Strategic Perspective** — I think like an attacker, report like a responder, and communicate like a leader
