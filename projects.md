## **🛡️ Enterprise Security & Asset Management**  

🔹 **[Enterprise Asset Discovery & CMDB Implementation](enterprise_asset_discovery.md)**  
*Performed network-wide scanning, categorized assets, and integrated findings into iTop CMDB for security tracking.*  
✅ Conducted **Nmap, PowerShell, and LDAP-based scans** to identify and categorize 40+ assets.  
✅ Classified devices into **honeypots, workstations, firewalls, servers, and switches**.  
✅ Created a **centralized CMDB using iTop** to enhance **SOC monitoring & threat visibility**.  
✅ Assisted in **reducing attack surface** by identifying unauthorized or misconfigured devices.
