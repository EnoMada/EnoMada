# Network Modernization for YagÃ© Botanicals  

## Project Overview  
In this project, I developed a **network modernization proposal** for **YagÃ© Botanicals**, a 75-year-old greenhouse business preparing for a potential sale. Their outdated infrastructure, including slow internet, unsegmented networks, and missing security patches, raised red flags for buyers. I proposed cost-effective solutions, including cloud migration, VLAN implementation, and endpoint security improvements, to modernize their systems and enhance their appeal to potential buyers.  

## Client Communication  

> **Email from YagÃ© Botanicals:**  
> "We need to modernize our infrastructure to attract buyers without overspending. Please help us identify practical, cost-effective upgrades that will improve our operations and security."

## Project Objectives and Approach  

### **Objective**  
Modernize YagÃ© Botanicalsâ€™ infrastructure to improve operational efficiency, enhance security, and increase appeal to potential buyers.  

### **Approach**  
- **Asset Identification:** Conducted a full inventory of hardware and software using a CMDB to document critical assets.  
- **Basic Security Measures:** Implemented VLANs to segment the network and applied critical security patches to outdated systems.  
- **Cloud Migration Strategy:** Proposed a phased migration to a public cloud provider, consolidating 12 overworked servers into a streamlined cloud environment.  
- **Endpoint Security:** Introduced a SaaS MDM solution to enforce BYOD policies and improve endpoint protection.  
- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Recommended implementing a **SNOC (Security and Network Operations Center)** for continuous monitoring and threat detection.  

## SOC Analyst Skills Showcased  
- **Network Hardening & Segmentation**  
- **Cloud Migration Planning**  
- **Endpoint Security Management**  
- **Security Policy Development**  
- **Vulnerability Assessment & Patching**  
- **Stakeholder Communication & Proposal Writing**  

## Key Learnings and Recommendations  

### **Asset Management**  
- **CMDB Implementation:** A comprehensive inventory of hardware and software is critical for identifying risks and planning upgrades.  
- **VLAN Segmentation:** Network segmentation limits lateral movement and protects sensitive systems from internal threats.  

### **Cloud Migration**  
- **Phased Approach:** A gradual migration to the cloud reduces risks and ensures minimal disruption to operations.  
- **Cost-Effective Solutions:** Prioritizing high-ROI upgrades, such as patching and 2FA, aligns with the clientâ€™s budget constraints.  

### **Endpoint Security**  
- **MDM Solutions:** Enforcing BYOD policies through a SaaS MDM improves endpoint security without requiring significant investment.  
- **2FA Implementation:** Adding two-factor authentication for privileged accounts enhances access security.  

### **Ongoing Monitoring**  
- **SNOC Implementation:** A Security and Network Operations Center provides continuous monitoring and improves threat detection capabilities.  
- **Policy Development:** Formalizing IT policies and procedures ensures long-term stability and compliance.  

## Conclusion  
This project reinforced my ability to develop practical, cost-effective solutions for modernizing outdated infrastructure. By addressing YagÃ© Botanicalsâ€™ key challengesâ€”slow internet, unsegmented networks, and missing security patchesâ€”I helped them create a more attractive and secure environment for potential buyers. This experience highlighted the importance of balancing technical improvements with business goals, especially in preparation for a sale.
