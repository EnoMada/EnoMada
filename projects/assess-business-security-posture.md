# Assess a Business’s Security Posture

**Sprint 3: Cyber Security Frameworks**

## Project Overview

In this project, I conducted a detailed assessment of the security posture for a small business—Rigel Cybernetics Institute. The project began with a collaborative email from the client, requesting an evaluation of their existing IRP and overall security processes.

## Project Objectives and Approach

- **Objective:** Improve internal processes to prevent malware outbreaks and bolster the organization’s security posture.
- **Approach:**  
  - Analyze the current IRP and related communications.
  - Identify vulnerabilities and "wicked problems" inherent in the organization’s security structure.
  - Develop high ROI recommendations focused on layered defenses and risk mitigation.

## Key Learnings and Recommendations

- **Wicked Problems in Cybersecurity:**  
  Acknowledge that perfect security is unattainable; focus on managing complexity through layered defenses.
- **ROI-Driven Strategies:**  
  Emphasize methods that provide measurable impact with feasible implementation and maintenance.
- **Future Considerations:**  
  How to continuously adapt and refine security processes in response to evolving threats.

## Conclusion

This project deepened my understanding of how to assess and enhance a business’s security posture by balancing practical recommendations with the complexities of real-world cybersecurity challenges.
