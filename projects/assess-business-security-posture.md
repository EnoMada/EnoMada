# 🔒 Assessing a Business’s Security Posture  

## 📌 Overview  

I conducted a **security posture assessment** for **Rigel Cybernetics Institute (RCI)** after they experienced a **ransomware attack** that disrupted critical operations. My analysis identified security gaps, extracted key risk factors, and provided **high-ROI security recommendations** based on **NIST best practices**. The final deliverable included an **updated incident response plan, risk mitigation strategies, and a security improvement roadmap** to strengthen their defenses and prevent future breaches.  

> **Email from Willa Herzog, CEO of Rigel Cybernetics Institute:**  
> *"We’re so excited to begin this collaboration with you! Now that all our contracts are signed, we’d love to jump directly into one of our highest priorities: improving our internal processes to prevent future malware outbreaks from devastating our flagship hospital. Please review our attached IRP and supporting email chains to get started on our analysis."*

## 🚀 Walkthrough  

### **1️⃣ Reviewing the Incident Response Plan (IRP)**  

#### **Scenario**  
- RCI, a small business, suffered a **ransomware attack** affecting core operations.  
- Their existing **Incident Response Plan (IRP) was outdated** and lacked **clear escalation paths**.

#### **Analysis**  
- **Reviewed casefile evidence** related to the ransomware incident.  
- **Extracted key cybersecurity issues**, including lack of segmentation, weak endpoint protection, and response delays.  
- **Clustered similar vulnerabilities** to streamline remediation strategies.  

---

### **2️⃣ Root Cause Identification & Security Recommendations**  

#### **Key Security Gaps Found**  
- **Lack of Endpoint Security Controls** – No established **EDR** or **SIEM monitoring**.  
- **Weak Network Segmentation** – Critical assets were **not isolated** from low-trust environments.  
- **Slow Incident Response** – No **clear escalation process** or structured playbooks.  

#### **Proposed Solutions**  
- **Implement Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)** tools to improve visibility.  
- **Strengthen Network Segmentation** with VLANs and Zero Trust principles.  
- **Develop & Train IR Teams** with defined escalation paths and tabletop exercises.  

#### **Before vs After Security Posture Enhancement**  

| **Metric**                      | **Pre-Enhancement**               | **Post-Enhancement**                |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Endpoint Protection Level       | Low (Minimal logging)            | High (EDR, SIEM implemented)   |
| Network Segmentation            | Poor (Flat network)              | Strong (VLANs, Least Privilege)  |
| Incident Response Readiness     | Unstructured & Slow              | Documented Playbooks & Training |

---

### **3️⃣ Final Report & Recommendations**  

#### **Why This Matters for SOC Analysts**  
- Strengthens **incident response frameworks** based on real-world case studies.  
- Reinforces **risk-based decision-making** for **security posture improvements**.  
- Highlights **layered defense strategies** aligned with NIST guidelines.  

#### **Submitted Deliverables**  
- **Security Posture Assessment Report** detailing findings & recommendations.  
- **Incident Response Plan (IRP) Review** with structured escalation and playbooks.  
- **Actionable Roadmap** prioritizing high-ROI cybersecurity improvements.
