# Assess a Business’s Security Posture

## Project Overview

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive security posture assessment for Rigel Cybernetics Institute (RCI), a small business impacted by a ransomware incident. I reviewed a detailed casefile, extracted key cybersecurity issues, identified root causes, and clustered similar problems to streamline my analysis. Based on industry best practices, I researched and prioritized high-ROI solutions and compiled my findings into a formal report with tailored recommendations.

## Client Communication

> **Email from Willa Herzog, CEO of Rigel Cybernetics Institute:**  
> "We’re so excited to begin this collaboration with you! Now that all our contracts are signed, we’d love to jump directly into one of our highest priorities: improving our internal processes to prevent future malware outbreaks from devastating our flagship hospital. Please review our attached IRP and supporting email chains to get started on our analysis."

## Project Objectives and Approach

- **Objective:** Enhance RCI’s security posture by evaluating their current Incident Response Plan (IRP) and identifying vulnerabilities.
- **Approach:**
  - **Review Casefile:** Analyze evidence from RCI’s ransomware incident.
  - **Extract Information:** Mine the casefile for cybersecurity-related issues.
  - **Identify Root Causes:** Determine the underlying reasons for each problem.
  - **Cluster Issues:** Consolidate similar root causes to focus on critical issues.
  - **Research Solutions:** Identify and propose best-practice solutions.
  - **Prioritize Recommendations:** Rank solutions based on risk reduction and RCI’s business priorities.
  - **Report Writing:** Document the analysis and recommendations in a formal report.
  - **Submission & Review:** Prepare the project folder and submit the report for senior feedback.
