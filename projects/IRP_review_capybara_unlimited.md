# Incident Response Plan Review for Capybara Unlimited  

## Project Overview  
In this project, I reviewed and revised the **incident response plan (IRP)** for **Capybara Unlimited**, a leading exotic pet retailer. Their existing IRP contained outdated and problematic advice, which I corrected to align with **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** best practices. The updated plan now ensures effective incident handling, clear communication, and robust mitigation strategies for threats like malware infections, phishing, and denial-of-service attacks.

## 🚀 Walkthrough  

### **1️⃣ Identifying Gaps in the Existing IRP**  

#### **Scenario**  
- Capybara Unlimited's IRP contained **outdated response procedures** that lacked clear escalation paths and reporting protocols.  
- The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** was not referenced, reducing alignment with industry standards.  

#### **Analysis**  
- **Reviewed existing IRP** and compared it with **NIST guidelines** to identify missing components.  
- **Flagged ineffective response strategies**, such as undefined roles during critical incidents.  
- **Recommended structured escalation paths** and standardized communication methods.

### **2️⃣ Aligning with NIST Cybersecurity Framework**  

#### **Framework Implementation**  
- **Identified missing phases** in the IRP using the **NIST Incident Response Lifecycle**:
  - Preparation
  - Detection & Analysis
  - Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
  - Post-Incident Activity

- **Updated the IRP** with a structured approach to **incident detection, escalation, and resolution**.
- **Defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** to measure IRP effectiveness and ensure continuous improvement.  

#### **Before vs After IRP Update**  

| **Metric**                   | **Pre-Update**                   | **Post-Update**                   |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Incident Escalation Time      | Undefined Processes             | Clear Reporting & Escalation Paths |
| Compliance with NIST Framework | Partial Adherence               | Full Alignment with NIST Guidelines |
| Role Assignments              | Unclear Responsibilities        | Defined IR Team Roles & Playbooks  |

### **3️⃣ Playbook Development**  

#### **Why Playbooks Matter**  
- **Ensures consistency** in responding to security threats.  
- **Minimizes response time** by providing predefined steps.  
- **Improves decision-making** by guiding analysts through mitigation steps.  

#### **Playbooks Created**  
- **Malware Infection Playbook** – Covers initial detection, isolation, remediation, and reporting steps.  
- **Phishing Incident Playbook** – Guides security teams on identifying, containing, and mitigating phishing attacks.  
- **Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Playbook** – Provides mitigation strategies to sustain availability during attacks.
