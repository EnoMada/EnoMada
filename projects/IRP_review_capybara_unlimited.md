# Incident Response Plan Review for Capybara Unlimited  

## Project Overview  
In this project, I reviewed and revised the **incident response plan (IRP)** for **Capybara Unlimited**, a leading exotic pet retailer. Their existing IRP contained outdated and problematic advice, which I corrected to align with **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** best practices. The updated plan now ensures effective incident handling, clear communication, and robust mitigation strategies for threats like malware infections, phishing, and denial-of-service attacks.
