# 🔒 Enterprise Asset Discovery & CMDB Implementation for MegaQuagga

## 📌 Overview

This project focused on **enhancing network visibility and security monitoring** for **MegaQuagga Publishing's IT Security Team**. Using **Nmap, PowerShell scripting, and LDAP queries**, I conducted comprehensive asset discovery, identifying **over 30 critical network devices** including firewalls, web servers, databases, and workstations. The detailed findings were documented and integrated into **iTop CMDB**, centralizing asset management to significantly enhance SOC monitoring capabilities and proactively manage the company's security posture.

> **Email from MegaQuagga IT Security Team:**  
> *"We need a thorough understanding of our network assets and a reliable system for tracking them in our CMDB. Please perform an extensive asset enumeration and integrate the results into our iTop CMDB for better security visibility and monitoring."*

## 🚀 Walkthrough

### **1️⃣ Network Scanning & Asset Enumeration**

#### **Scenario**
- IT Security Team at MegaQuagga requested comprehensive asset discovery to address concerns around incomplete asset inventories leading to increased security risks.

#### **Analysis**
- Performed extensive **Nmap network scans** to detect active IP addresses, open ports, and running services.
- Leveraged **PowerShell and LDAP queries** to enumerate authenticated assets from Active Directory.
- Utilized **device fingerprinting** techniques to classify discovered assets such as firewalls, web servers, database servers, and user endpoints.

```bash
# Nmap scan example
nmap -sV -T4 -A 10.10.20.0/24
# Expected Output: Comprehensive list of active hosts and detailed service information
```

### **2️⃣ Asset Classification & Security Mapping**

#### **Asset Categorization**
- Compiled the identified assets into a structured spreadsheet, providing clear visibility for ongoing security monitoring.
- Highlighted anomalies including unauthorized or incorrectly configured devices.

#### **Before vs After Asset Tracking**

| **Metric**                    | **Pre-Implementation**          | **Post-Implementation**           |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Untracked Assets              | High (incomplete records)       | Low (centralized, complete records) |
| CMDB Data Accuracy            | Partial                          | Comprehensive and verified        |
| Security Monitoring Readiness | Limited visibility               | Enhanced threat detection         |

---

### **3️⃣ CMDB Integration & Threat Surface Reduction**

#### **CMDB Implementation**
- Imported and structured asset data within **iTop CMDB**, creating a robust and retrievable asset management system.
- Aligned assets with **security policies, alerting rules, and network segmentation** for improved threat detection and response.

```powershell
# PowerShell query for asset enumeration from AD
Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties Name,OperatingSystem,IPv4Address
```

#### **Security Improvements**
- Identified and mitigated previously unmonitored rogue devices.
- Enhanced proactive monitoring capabilities through structured CMDB integration.
- Improved overall risk management and asset visibility.
