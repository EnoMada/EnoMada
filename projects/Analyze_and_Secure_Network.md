# 🔒 Network Modernization for Tempus Fugit Timepieces  

## 📌 Overview  

This project involved **modernizing and securing the legacy network infrastructure** of **Tempus Fugit Timepieces**, a century-old watch manufacturer preparing for potential acquisition. The existing network, built on outdated **Token Ring topology** and **legacy IBM AS/400 architecture**, suffered from **high downtime, slow internet speeds, and cybersecurity risks**.  

To address these issues, I designed a **modernized network architecture** featuring **mesh topology, cloud integration, VPN implementation, and enterprise-grade security enhancements**. The restructured network improves **availability, scalability, and security** while aligning with **business goals and investor requirements** for improved disaster recovery, remote access, and future scalability.  

> **Email from Tempus Fugit Leadership:**  
> *"We need a network that will support modern business operations, ensure security, and provide flexibility as we look toward potential acquisition. Please recommend solutions that will enhance our IT infrastructure while maintaining reliability."*

## 🚀 Walkthrough  

### **1️⃣ Mesh Topology & Infrastructure Upgrade**  

#### **Scenario**  
- **Legacy Token Ring topology** caused **network congestion, downtime, and single points of failure**.  
- High-risk **unpatched legacy systems** relied on outdated **routers incapable of handling modern bandwidth needs**.  

#### **Solution & Benefits**  
- **Replaced Token Ring with a Mesh Network**, ensuring **redundancy and high availability**.  
- **Upgraded routers** for **faster speeds, scalability, and encrypted traffic**.  


﻿CIA Impact:
 
🔹 **Confidentiality**: Secure traffic flows via encrypted routing.

🔹 **Integrity**: Eliminated single points of failure for stable communication.

🔹 **Availability**: Improved uptime through redundant connection paths.

### **2️⃣ WiFi 6 Deployment & Secure Remote Access**  

#### **Scenario**  
- Employees **lacked wireless connectivity**, restricting their ability to work efficiently.  
- **No secure remote access**, requiring employees to be **physically in the office** to retrieve company data.  

#### **Solution & Benefits**  
- **Installed enterprise-grade WiFi 6 access points**, supporting **high-speed, secure wireless communication**.  
- **Implemented VPN with encryption**, enabling **secure remote work** while **protecting data in transit**.  


﻿CIA Impact:
 
🔹 **Confidentiality**: WPA3 encryption prevents unauthorized wireless access.

🔹 **Integrity**: VPN ensures data integrity by preventing interception/modification.

🔹 **Availability**: Employees can securely access systems from anywhere.



---

### **3️⃣ Cloud Integration & Business Continuity**  

#### **Scenario**  
- **No cloud-based disaster recovery solution**, increasing **business risk in case of outages**.  
- **No automated backup strategy**, making recovery **slow and unreliable**.  

#### **Solution & Benefits**  
- **Migrated critical systems to the cloud**, reducing **dependency on aging physical hardware**.  
- **Implemented cloud-based disaster recovery**, ensuring **fast data restoration and high availability**.  


﻿CIA Impact:
 
🔹 **Confidentiality**: Cloud firewall and encryption secure stored data.

🔹 **Integrity**: Regular integrity checks ensure data remains unaltered.

🔹 **Availability**: Critical business operations continue during outages.
