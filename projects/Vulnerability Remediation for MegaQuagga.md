# 🔒 Vulnerability Remediation for MegaQuagga

## 📌 Overview

This project involved remediating critical vulnerabilities in **MegaQuagga Publishing’s web infrastructure**, specifically addressing issues related to **unencrypted traffic**, lack of **application-layer protections**, and **direct exposure** of internal services to the internet. Implementations included setting up **SSL offloading** via HTTPS and deploying a **Layer 7 Web Application Firewall (WAF)** using **ModSecurity** paired with the **OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS)**. These enhancements significantly fortified MegaQuagga’s security posture by mitigating major vulnerabilities and aligning with modern network security standards.

> **MegaQuagga Security Team:**  
> *"Due to critical findings during the recent vulnerability assessment, our WordPress server was identified as vulnerable to a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attack—a serious threat that could allow attackers to execute malicious code remotely. We need effective remediations implemented and carefully documented."*

## 🚀 Walkthrough

### **1️⃣ Web Application Firewall (WAF) Deployment**

#### **Scenario**
- Web server directly exposed to external threats due to lack of Layer 7 firewall protection.

#### **Analysis & Implementation**
```bash
# Deployed ModSecurity WAF with OWASP CRS
# Configured reverse proxy to shield web server from direct access
# Successfully mitigated Remote File Inclusion (RFI) exploit attempts
```

#### **📊 Before vs After**  
| **Item**                     | **Original State**                      | **Remediated State**                      |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Web Server Exposure**      | Directly exposed                        | Shielded by reverse proxy                 |
| **Firewall Layer Coverage**  | Layer 4 (Transport Layer)               | Layer 7 (Application Layer) WAF           |
| **Attack Surface**           | No application-layer protection          | OWASP CRS implementation blocking attacks |

### **2️⃣ SSL Offloading and HTTPS Encryption**

#### **🔧 Tools Used**
- Apache Reverse Proxy
- Self-signed SSL Certificate
- pfSense Firewall

#### **Implementation Steps**
```bash
# Upgraded HTTP (port 80) to HTTPS (port 443)
# Generated and installed a self-signed SSL certificate
# Configured Apache to redirect HTTP to HTTPS
# Updated pfSense firewall rules and NAT to route HTTPS traffic correctly
```

#### **📊 Before vs After**  
| **Item**                | **Original State**                             | **Remediated State**                                 |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Traffic Encryption**  | Unencrypted (HTTP)                             | Encrypted (HTTPS/TLS)                                |
| **SSL Certificate**     | None                                           | Self-signed SSL certificate installed                |
| **Apache Configuration**| HTTP-only                                      | HTTP redirected to HTTPS                             |
| **Firewall Rules**      | No inbound traffic allowed on port 443         | HTTPS traffic allowed and routed through NAT         |

## 🌟 Lessons Learned

### 🔐 **Defense in Depth**
- Integrating multiple layers of security significantly improves resilience against sophisticated web-based attacks.

### 💡 **Importance of Layer 7 Protection**
- Layer 7 WAFs, such as ModSecurity, effectively mitigate threats that traditional Layer 4 firewalls cannot detect.

### 📜 **Secure Communication Standards**
- Enforcing HTTPS encryption through SSL offloading is essential for protecting data and complying with modern standards.
