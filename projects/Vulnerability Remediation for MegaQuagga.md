# 🔒 Vulnerability Remediation for MegaQuagga

## 📌 Overview

This project involved **remediating critical vulnerabilities** discovered during a security assessment of **MegaQuagga's WordPress server**, particularly a severe **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** vulnerability. The RFI vulnerability posed significant risks, potentially allowing attackers to execute malicious remote code. I employed a comprehensive **defense-in-depth strategy** that incorporated encryption, proactive detection, packet capture analysis, and detailed documentation. These targeted security improvements significantly strengthened the security posture of MegaQuagga’s web infrastructure.

> **MegaQuagga Security Team:**  
> *"Due to critical findings during the recent vulnerability assessment, our WordPress server was identified as vulnerable to a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attack—a serious threat that could allow attackers to execute malicious code remotely. We need effective remediations implemented and carefully documented."*
