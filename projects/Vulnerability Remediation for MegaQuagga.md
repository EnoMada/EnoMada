# Vulnerability Remediation for MegaQuagga

## Project Overview

In this project, I addressed critical vulnerabilities identified during a security assessment of MegaQuagga's WordPress server, notably a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The RFI posed a severe threat, allowing attackers potential remote code execution. My approach utilized a defense-in-depth strategy, implementing multiple layers of security measures and thoroughly documenting each remediation step. These proactive measures significantly strengthened MegaQuagga's web server against exploitation.

## Client Communication

> **MegaQuagga Security Team:**  
> "Due to critical findings during the recent vulnerability assessment, our WordPress server was identified as vulnerable to a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attack—a serious threat that could allow attackers to execute malicious code remotely. We need effective remediations implemented and carefully documented."
