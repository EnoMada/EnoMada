# **Enterprise Asset Discovery & CMDB Implementation**  
🚀 **Enhancing Network Visibility & Security Monitoring**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project demonstrates **comprehensive network scanning, asset enumeration, and CMDB integration** to improve **security monitoring and incident response**. Using **Nmap, PowerShell, LDAP queries, and other enumeration tools**, I identified and classified **40+ corporate IP addresses**, mapping them to **honeypots, workstations, firewalls, servers, and switches**. The final results were documented in a **spreadsheet** and integrated into **iTop**, a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), to centralize security-relevant asset details.

## **🔍 Key Steps & Tools**   

### **1️⃣ Network Scanning & Enumeration**  
✅ Conducted scans using **Nmap & Zenmap** to detect open ports, running services, and system fingerprints.  
✅ Executed **PowerShell & LDAP queries** to extract detailed system and user information.  
✅ Utilized **FFUF, SMB scripts, and HTTP headers analysis** to identify web-facing assets and SMB shares.  

📌 **Proof of Work:** *(Attach raw scan results, logs, or relevant screenshots here)*  

### **2️⃣ Asset Classification & Security Mapping**  
✅ Categorized **honeypots, firewalls, servers, workstations, and switches** based on scan results.  
✅ Documented findings in a **spreadsheet containing IPs, system roles, and potential security risks**.  

📌 **Proof of Work:** [View the Asset Enumeration Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jdsW1MjfQwm7uqFsAp59PHG5vOPwZSeJNPdEL_-nqCc/edit?usp=sharing)  

### **3️⃣ CMDB Integration in iTop**  
✅ Structured all **device and asset details** into **iTop CMDB** for long-term tracking and security monitoring.  
✅ Ensured the database reflects **accurate network topology, asset dependencies, and security classifications**.  

📌 **Proof of Work:** *(Include screenshots of iTop CMDB setup and populated data entries)*  

### **4️⃣ Network Visibility & Threat Surface Reduction**  
✅ Improved **SOC monitoring** by mapping critical assets and strengthening threat detection.  
✅ Assisted in **reducing attack surface** by identifying **unauthorized or misconfigured devices**.  

📌 **Proof of Work:** *(Attach summary report highlighting improvements in asset tracking and security visibility)*
