# Enterprise Asset Discovery & CMDB Implementation

## Project Overview

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive enterprise asset discovery and CMDB implementation to enhance network visibility and security monitoring. Using tools like Nmap, PowerShell, and LDAP queries, I identified and classified over 40 corporate IP addresses, mapping them to honeypots, workstations, firewalls, servers, and switches. The findings were documented in a spreadsheet and integrated into iTop, a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), to centralize security-relevant asset details and improve SOC monitoring capabilities.

## Client Communication

> **Email from IT Security Team:**  
> "We need to improve our network visibility and ensure all assets are properly tracked in our CMDB. Please conduct a thorough asset discovery and help us integrate the findings into iTop for better security monitoring."

## Project Objectives and Approach

- **Objective:** Enhance network visibility and security monitoring through comprehensive asset discovery and CMDB integration.  
- **Approach:**  
  - **Network Scanning & Enumeration:** Conducted scans using Nmap, Zenmap, PowerShell, and LDAP queries to identify open ports, running services, and system fingerprints.  
  - **Asset Classification & Security Mapping:** Categorized assets (honeypots, firewalls, servers, workstations, switches) and documented findings in a detailed spreadsheet.  
  - **CMDB Integration:** Structured all device and asset details into iTop CMDB for long-term tracking and monitoring.  
  - **Threat Surface Reduction:** Identified unauthorized or misconfigured devices to reduce the attack surface.  

## SOC Analyst Skills Showcased

- **Network Scanning & Enumeration**  
- **Asset Classification & Documentation**  
- **CMDB Implementation & Management**  
- **Threat Surface Analysis**  
- **Incident Response Readiness**  
- **Enterprise Security Monitoring**  

## Key Learnings and Recommendations

- **Centralized Asset Tracking:** A well-maintained CMDB is critical for effective security monitoring and incident response.  
- **Proactive Network Visibility:** Regular asset discovery helps identify unauthorized devices and reduce attack surfaces.  
- **Automation Opportunities:** Scripting tools like PowerShell can significantly speed up asset enumeration and classification.  

## Conclusion

This project reinforced my ability to conduct proactive security monitoring, asset discovery, and risk management within an enterprise network. By integrating findings into iTop CMDB, I improved network visibility and laid the groundwork for more effective SOC operations. This experience highlighted the importance of accurate asset tracking in strengthening an organizationâ€™s overall security posture.
